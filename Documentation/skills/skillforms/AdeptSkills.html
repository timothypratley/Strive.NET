Air Claw                Adepts can use the air to claw at their 
                        opponents during battle and cause a moderate 
                        amount of damage.

Duration                N/A
Use                     Attack spell
Syntax                  Cast ‘air claw’ (target)
Affect                  The damage of air claw is of course modified 
                        by cognition of caster over willpower of target 
                        and also by the affinity check. It is difficult 
                        to estimate what is going to be reasonable 
                        damage for this spell, perhaps something like a 
                        base damage of 50.
