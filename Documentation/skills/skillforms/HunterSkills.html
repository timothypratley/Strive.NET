Weapon technique        Basically the second attack skill, enabling 
                        those skilled in fighting to perform two attacks 
                        each round in a weapon they have trained 
                        (see above). 

Duration                Permanent.
Use                     Skilled fighters have an advantage over those 
                        not trained in the use of weaponry.

Syntax                  None
Affect                  Can perform two attacks per round. The chance of 
                        success of the second attack follows the same 
                        rules as the first attack with the exception that 
                        the boundaries for a successful hit change.

                        With a single attack you have a 25% of missing 
                        totally, a 50% of hitting their armour and 25% 
                        chance of hitting and bypassing their armour.

                        The second attack would have a 35% chance of 
                        missing, a 50% chance of hitting their armour 
                        and a 15% chance of bypassing their armour.

                                affect. If you are wielding no weapon then 
                                they need the unarmed combat skill at 95%

Practice Cost                   Can practice to 75%, costs 1 practice point 
                                for every percent. Max % is 95.

Casting costs etc               Costs you an extra 5 energy every combat round 
                                that you successfully use the skill

                        used successfully when firing an arrow at an 
                        opponent.

                        Without any extra skills you can only shoot a

Affect                  You can only use advanced camouflage in outdoor

                        of camouflaging but can be searched for. If 
                        you speak you are revealed, if you move you are 
                        revealed. If you do perform any action (unless 
                        it is stealthed somehow) you are revealed.

			The advantage of advanced camouflage over normal
			camouflage is that it does not display a message
			to those in the room when you attempt to conceal
			yourself.
