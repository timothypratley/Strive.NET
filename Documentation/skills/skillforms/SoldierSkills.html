Weapon technique        Basically the second attack skill, enabling 
                        those skilled in fighting to perform two attacks 
                        each round in a weapon they have trained 
                        (see above).

                        the boundaries for a successful hit change.

                        totally, a 50% of hitting their armour and 25% 
                        chance of hitting and bypassing their armour.
